<p class="spaced">This message is fake! There is no evidence of a NASA SD13 wave detector, there's no confirmation from NASA to show that the 5PM clapping did anything to show that the Coronavirus is retreating in India. The number of daily Coronavirus cases are only rising in India, and are expected to rise sharply in the coming days. All of us here in India need to exercise sound personal judgement and stay safe indoors as much as possible.
